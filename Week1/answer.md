Yes, I agree with @alittleton98 . The code answer provided is assuming the ending station id we should be looking at only is end station id 279. Removing that part from the '$match': {'start station id': 279, 'end station id': 279} to instead make that line be '$match': {'start station id': 279) only, and keep the '$sortByCount' and '$limit' code sections in the pipeline as well. That should give you the id 259 instead as your answer.
